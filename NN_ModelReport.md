Overview:
This Challenge aims to develop a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The project will utilize the features present in the given dataset machine learning methods to train and assess the model's performance. The objective is to optimize the model to achieve a trget predictive accuracy score higher than 75%.

Results:
1. Data Preprocessing:
The model aims to predict the success of applicants if they receive funding. This is indicated by the IS_SUCCESSFUL column in the dataset which is the target variable of the model. The feature variables areall the  columns other than the target variable and the non-relevant variables such as EIN and names. The features capture relevant information about the data and can be used in predicting the target variables, the non-relevant variables that are neither targets nor features will be drop from the dataset to avoid potential noise that might confuse the model.
2. During preprocessing, I implemented binning for rare occurrences in the APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION columns. Subsequently, I transformed categorical data into numeric data using the one-hot encoding technique. I split the data into separate sets for features and targets, as well as for training and testing. Lastly, I scaled the data to ensure uniformity in the data distribution.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
Initial Model: For my initial model, I decided to include 2 layers: an input layer with a rate of 3 neurons, a second layer with a rate of 0.5, and an output layer with 1 neuron. I made this choice to ensure that the total number of neurons in the model was between 2-3 times the number of input features. In this case, there were 42 input features remaining after removing 2 irrelevant ones. I selected the relu activation function for the first and second layers, and the sigmoid activation function for the output layer since the goal was binary classification. To start, I trained the model for 100 epochs and achieved an accuracy score of approximately 74% for the training data and 72.79% for the testing data. There was no apparent indication of overfitting or underfitting.

Optimization attempts:

I attempted to optimize the modelâ€™s performance by keeping the NAME column in the dataframe and architecture of the model by adding third layer with a rate of 0.2 to enhance the generalization. I selected the same relu activation function and sigmoid activation functions. With that I got an accuracy score of 77% for my training set and 75.3% for my testing set.

Summary:
Given that I attained the target accuracy of more than 75%, by experimenting with different preprocessing modifications. I believe that making few changes to the dataset by keeping few columns or dropping some columns, and adding or adjusting the layers and neurons, I wouldn suggest to go with the optimized model.
